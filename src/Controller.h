#ifndef Controller_h
#define Controller_h

///
/// This class acts as an interface/default implementation of a Component
/// controller. Its main purpose is to manage the contained Components,
/// providing a coordinated initialization and shutdown of the Components.
/// It also acts as the creator of Components, based on configuration 
/// information from the Keymaster.
///
/// So an application might follow the following sequence:
/// - The application is executed, main() is entered.
/// - main() creates an instance of a Controller, passing
/// information such as a configuration filename, and a dictionary
/// of Component type names to factory methods.
/// - The Controller creates a Keymaster, and passes on the configuration 
/// filename.
/// - The Keymaster reads the configuration file and stores it into a
/// tree-like structure, which reflects the configuration file contents.
/// - The Controller interacts (reads) the data, and creates instances
/// of Components specified by the config file.
/// - As Components are created, each of them retrieves the list of
///  inter-component connections along with any special Component configuration
///  information.
/// - Each Component registers itself with the Keymaster and adds 
/// entries for its state/status.
/// - As the Components registered themselves, the Controller subscribes 
/// to the state/status entries in the Keymaster.
/// .
///
/// At this point the system is in its initial state.
