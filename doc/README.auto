How to build:
=============
If autoconf/automake/autogen .... are installed on your system, installing
should be straightforward.

1. For the very first time, you probably want to run "autogen.sh" in
   the top directory. This should end up producing a ./configure script.
2. Run ./configure with what ever args you might need (e.g. --prefix)
   The configure script should end up generating Makefiles in each directory.
3. If steps 1&2 worked, you can just run 'make'.

Done!
